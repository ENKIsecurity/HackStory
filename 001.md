# The employee who left with the keys

During a pentest I was faced to a completely updated Joomla CMS, nothing overwhelmed ...

[CMSmap](https://github.com/Dionach/CMSmap.git) extracted a list of administrators : first letter of firstname and complete lastname format.
```
jwoo
kmarx
arimbaud
mshirow
cmiller
```

Looking for the most relevant profile on Linkedin with a Google dork : I came across this.
`site:linkedin.com John Woo Company`

I discovered that Mr. John Woo left the Company eight months ago. Pay day! His account is still active.

By pretending to be an employee, I contacted him telling him the story of a technical problem that requires his password to delete his account from the database.

And so the story of a hack.
