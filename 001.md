# The employee who left with the keys

During a pentest for the Company I was faced to a completely updated Joomla CMS, nothing overwhelmed ...

Using cmsmap (https://github.com/Dionach/CMSmap.git) I extracted a list of administrators with this format : 
* first letter of firstname + complete lastname.
```
jwoo
kmarx
arimbaud
mshirow
cmiller
```

I was looking for the most relevant profile on Linkedin with a Google dork
`site:linkedin.com John Woo Company`

![jwoo](./img/jwoo.jpg)

I discovered that Mr. John Woo left the Company eight months ago. Pay day! His account is still active.

By pretending to be an employee, I contacted him telling him the story of a technical problem that requires his password to delete his account from the database.

And so the story of a hack.
