# The employee who left with the keys

During a pentest I was faced to a completely updated Joomla CMS, nothing overwhelmed ...

[CMSmap](https://github.com/Dionach/CMSmap.git) extracted a list of administrators : first letter of firstname and complete lastname format.
```

Looking for the most relevant profile on Linkedin ...

I came across this. I discovered that Mr. John Woo left the Company eight months ago. Surprise ! His account is still alive.

By pretending to be an employee, contacted him, telling him the story of a technical problem that requires his password to delete his account from the database. It is a social engineering plausible scenario.
