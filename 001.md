# Advanced Threat's Stories

During a pentest for a large compagny I was faced to a completely updated Drupal CMS, nothing overwhelmed ...

Using cmsmap (https://github.com/Dionach/CMSmap.git) I extracted a list of users with this format : 
* first letter of firstname + complete lastname.
```
jwoo
kmarx
arimbaud
mshirow
cmiller
```

I was looking for the most relevant profile on Linkedin by Dorking :
`site:linkedin.com John Woo Company`

I discovered that Mr. John Woo left the company eight months ago. Pay day! His account is still active.

By pretending to be an employee of the company, I contacted him telling him the story of a technical problem that requires a password to delete his account database.

And so the story of a hack.
