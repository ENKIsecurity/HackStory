# Advanced Threat's Stories

During a pentest for a large compagny I was faced to a completely updated Drupal CMS, nothing overwhelmed ...

Using cmsmap (https://github.com/Dionach/CMSmap.git) I extracted a list of users with this format : 
* first letter of firstname + complete lastname.
```
jwoo
kmarx
arimbaud
mshirow
cmiller
```
